[Link to Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/nabeel-h/port.io/blob/master/Notebooks/foo.txt)

This analysis takes a look at NBA community on the popular social media website [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com).
There are 32 teams in the NBA and as a result 33 subreddits (micro-communities): one for each [team](https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers) with an additional one for the [NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba) itself.

The analysis looks into the growth of the community and other interesting facts.

Data was obtained through an API over the course of a couple of days and the data was stored in a sqlite3 database.
A python data stack was used for analysis and data manipulation.
